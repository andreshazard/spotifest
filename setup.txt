Celery and Redis
================

pip install celery
pip install redis

Install redis onto your computer. Prior to running, in the command-line:
redis-server

and then another tab

celery worker -A library.app.celery -I config -c 3 --loglevel=info

and another tab for scheduled deletion of sessions:

celery beat â€”-app library.app.celery

-A - Points to app/celery location
-I - Imports modules (this is where config links for redis are)
-c - # of concurrent processes - play around with this based on your computer processing power
--loglevel=info - debug messages
